/*
Buses and passengers arrive at the LeetCode station. If a bus arrives at the station at time tbus and a passenger arrived at time tpassenger where tpassenger <= tbus and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus.

Write an SQL query to report the number of users that used each bus.

Return the result table ordered by bus_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Buses table:
+--------+--------------+
| bus_id | arrival_time |
+--------+--------------+
| 1      | 2            |
| 2      | 4            |
| 3      | 7            |
+--------+--------------+
Passengers table:
+--------------+--------------+
| passenger_id | arrival_time |
+--------------+--------------+
| 11           | 1            |
| 12           | 5            |
| 13           | 6            |
| 14           | 7            |
+--------------+--------------+
Output: 
+--------+----------------+
| bus_id | passengers_cnt |
+--------+----------------+
| 1      | 1              |
| 2      | 0              |
| 3      | 3              |
+--------+----------------+  */
